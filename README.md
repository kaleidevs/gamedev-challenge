## What is the Game Dev Tycoon challenge?

[Game Dev Tycoon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239820/Game_Dev_Tycoon/) is a game released by Greenheart Games in December 2012 following a fictional game studio's growth from 1980 through to now. Ever since it came out I had a dream of playing through the game and actually creating in real life every game idea that I mocked up.

It's not going to be pretty at first, but then again, the fake games I created in Game Dev Tycoon at first weren't very pretty either. So if you would like to follow my journey, and maybe even take the challenge on yourself, I'm so happy to have you!
